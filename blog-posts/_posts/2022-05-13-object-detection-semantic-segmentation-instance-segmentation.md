If we have an image like this where we have a bounding box around each individual then this is typically the _**object detection**_. 

Suppose, we have a bunch of cells in an image and if we put bounding box around each cell or a particle then it is also an _**object detection**_.

Now if we actually paint the pixels corresponding to humans in this image then that is _**semantic segmentation**_ where

Then if we can separate each individual like as person 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 then this is called _**instance segmentation**_ and this is an
extension of semantic segmentation in a way
