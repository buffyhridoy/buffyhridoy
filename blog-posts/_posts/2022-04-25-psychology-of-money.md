The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to
do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.
And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.

A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial
disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial
education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills
that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.

The crisis hurt virtually everyone’s finances. It apparently turned
anyone’s into dust.

Financial success is not a hard science. It’s a
soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you
know. This soft skill is called the `psychology of money`.

Finance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based field, where you
put data into a formula and the formula tells you what to do, and it’s
assumed that you’ll just go do it. This is true in personal finance, where you’re told to have a sixmonth emergency fund and save 10% of your salary.
It’s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations
between interest rates and valuations. And it’s true in corporate finance, where CFOs can measure the
precise cost of capital.

> Knowing what to do tells you nothing about what happens in your head when
you try to do it.
