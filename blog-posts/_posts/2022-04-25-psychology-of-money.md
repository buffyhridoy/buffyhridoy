The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to
do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.
And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.

A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial
disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial
education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills
that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.
