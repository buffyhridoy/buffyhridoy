Today we are going to discuss about maskRCNN for instance segmentation for medical images. What
happens often is if we have images we want to really know is how many regions of interest are there and
exactly where are they located. if we take a an image of our road outside we might see that there are multiple cars
there are multiple pedestrians. So in order for us to gause is there a traffic congestion or not we might need
to know how many cars there are and how many pedestrians there are. So whenever there is this need to count
how many instances are existing in an image and exactly where they are located. We call it an instant segmentation
method. Today we are going to be covering a whole code base on how to apply maskRCNN specifically for
instance segmentation.
